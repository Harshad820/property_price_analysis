- Price per square foot is highest in premium cities, showing strong market demand.
- Over the years, prices show a dip around 2021–2022, then a steady recovery.
- Bigger homes cost more, as seen in the area vs price trend, with a few luxury outliers.
- Overall, location, size, and condition are the biggest drivers of property pricing

## Data Story :
---
This analysis reveals how property prices change across different cities and home features. Big cities like New York and Los Angeles consistently show higher prices, reflecting stronger demand and premium living standards. As expected, larger homes with more bedrooms and better condition sell for more, while smaller or outdated homes are priced lower.

Over the years, prices dipped slightly but eventually recovered, showing market stability. The relationship between area and price also highlights that bigger homes generally cost more, with a few luxury exceptions. The data shows that location, size, and condition are the key factors shaping property values.
